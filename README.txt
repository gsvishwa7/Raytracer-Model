README:
-The raytracer.py script and functions.py do not need to be run. 
-They are modules containing classes and functions respectively, that are called into the other 3 scripts. 
-The scripts Plano_Convex_1.py, Plano_Convex_2.py and mirror_Script.py are for the plano-convex lens with
 the planar side facing the collimated light beam, the convex side facing the light beam and for the mirror
 respectively. These import the raytracer.py and functions.py modules.
